```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(race)
```

## Usage

The only required parameter is `name` which is the surname you want to find the race of. Please note that this parameter only accepts surnames, including both first and last name will result in not finding a match in the Census data. 


```{r}
race("Washington")
```

This function accepts a single string or a vector of strings.

```{r}
race(c("Washington", "Franklin", "Lincoln"))
```



If you only want the most likely race and not the individual probabilities of each race, set the parameter `probability` to FALSE.

```{r}
race("Washington", probability = FALSE)
```
